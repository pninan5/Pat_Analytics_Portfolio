## 👋 About Me

Hi, I am Pat — a data-driven problem solver passionate about using analytics and AI to make a real difference. I recently earned my Master’s in **Business Analytics and Artificial Intelligence** from **The University of Texas at Dallas**, where I combined technical depth with real-world application through impactful projects in healthcare, finance, marketing, and sustainability.

With over three years of experience as a data analyst and a strong foundation in computer science, I thrive at the intersection of data, business strategy, and human-centered impact. I have led initiatives that improved reporting accuracy, uncovered customer insights, automated critical workflows, and helped organizations make smarter decisions.

Previously, I served as a Teaching Assistant at UT Dallas, where I mentored students in analytical modeling and decision sciences. That experience not only sharpened my communication and leadership skills, but also deepened my passion for learning and sharing knowledge.

Now, I am looking for the next challenge — an opportunity where I can grow, collaborate, and build something meaningful. Whether it is helping a business scale with intelligent systems or uncovering insights that shape better decisions, I am excited to contribute to projects that have purpose.

I believe in doing work that matters and want to be part of a team where I can help **build a better tomorrow** through data, innovation, and shared ambition.

Outside of work, I enjoy playing soccer and basketball, leading my futsal team, running to stay energized, solving logic puzzles, and playing chess to sharpen my focus and strategic thinking. I bring that same energy and curiosity into everything I do.
