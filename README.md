## About Me
Hey there! Iâ€™m **Patrick Gervadis Ninan**, a graduate student diving deep into the world of **Business Analytics** and **Artificial Intelligence** at **The University of Texas at Dallas**. With a strong background in **Computer Science and Engineering**, Iâ€™m all about using data to solve real-world problems and create impactful solutions. From **predicting customer churn** to **optimizing marketing strategies**, I love seeing how data can drive smarter decisions. ðŸ§ ðŸ’¡

When Iâ€™m not crunching numbers or building AI models, youâ€™ll find me **leading my football team** on the field or engaging with peers as a **Teaching Assistant**. I believe in learning by doing, and I'm always up for new challengesâ€”whether itâ€™s building predictive models, solving complex problems, or collaborating on exciting data projects. So if you're looking for someone who's curious, data-driven, and loves a good challenge, let's connect! ðŸš€

I'm passionate about fostering collaboration and making data work for everyone, and Iâ€™m always eager to learn more through hands-on experience and teamwork. Data is my playground, and I canâ€™t wait to see where it takes me next!
